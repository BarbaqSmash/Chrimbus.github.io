		<td>1. You must immediately jump out of the bus as soon as the timer reaches 0:00
You are allowed to glide to any destination once you have exited the bus

2. The first weapon you pick up is the only weapon you can use
If you find a better tiered weapon that is the same as what you initially picked up you may swap for it
For example, if you pick up a Common Tactical Shotgun you are allowed to swap it for a Tactical Shotgun of better quality
This applies to all weapons except Grenades and Smoke Grenades

3a. You are allowed to use the following consumables
Bandages
Med Kits
Shield Potions
Slurp Juice
Bush (See Rule 3b)

3b. If you consume a bush potion you are no longer allowed to use any of the consumables in Rule 3a
You are allowed to use the consumables listed in Rule 3a prior to consuming a Bush Potion
This rule still applies even after the bush disguise has been removed from the player

4. You may only search one supply drop

5. You are allowed to revive fallen teammates
You are not allowed to revive a fallen teammate who has used a bush consumable. By:<a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/member/528249-therealhawkings">The Real Hawkings</a></td>
