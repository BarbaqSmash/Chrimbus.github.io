00:00
hey guys it's barbecue smash and welcome
00:02
back to my channel and in this episode
00:04
I'm gonna be showing you how to get a
00:07
texture pack in Minecraft or actually
00:10
how to get one and then upload it into
00:12
your Minecraft game so you can actually
00:14
play with it so I'm going to be using
00:16
the disco texture pack I know the OCD
00:19
texture pack sorry that I hope will make
00:25
the game a little faster for me probably
00:27
won't use it actually much but I'm just
00:29
showing for an example this a lot of
00:32
people don't actually know how to do
00:33
this and yeah let's get rid of this so
00:36
download you just wait for this monster
00:39
thingy which come on seriously sponsors
00:44
alright so I'll just wait this okay so
00:50
oh pretty soon time but so you just wait
00:57
till you found it and if I percent
00:59
complete do it do it do it and just wait
01:02
for it to finish
01:04
and then it'll download and what you're
01:06
gonna do is leave it in a zip file and
01:09
you're just gonna keep this open so it's
01:12
easier I'm gonna make ginger yet but so
01:16
what you're gonna do is type in in like
01:18
the search programs and files once
01:20
you've got thing downloaded percent %
01:24
AppData and then percent percent AppData
01:28
percent now you're gonna it's gonna show
01:29
up with something that says roaming on
01:31
it I'm shaking so much out but it's
01:34
gonna show up someone who says roaming
01:35
and you're gonna want to go to minecraft
01:37
that's my first one might not be for
01:39
yourself screen whoops that's so I'm
01:43
gonna go to resource packs and you're
01:47
gonna want to drag once you don't want
01:50
to drag it to the thing in it's actually
01:53
really simple to do this you're just
01:54
gonna want it drag it in it's got the
01:57
OCD thing in there I'm shaking it time
01:59
but anyway so yeah you got that all
02:02
uploaded now you're gonna open up
02:03
minecraft this is a last step not it's
02:05
not even really that hard it's pretty
02:07
simple pretty straightforward we're just
02:10
gonna go to the minecraft Launcher
02:12
click Play stop shaking I don't know why
02:16
you can send me like cold every um so
02:23
you hit play and then um you just wait
02:26
for it to load basically I got this new
02:29
whoops it's gone alright so I'm just
02:31
gonna exit this out and so you hit play
02:35
I'm gonna want to do is there are one of
02:39
two things that you can do now and I
02:41
think it's just simpler to actually test
02:43
it out is I'm gonna just go so number
02:48
one is you can just go to your settings
02:50
your options and then your videos your
02:55
resource packs made for an older version
02:58
of Minecraft okay so that's a problem so
03:01
you need to get one for the latest
03:03
version of Minecraft and you're gonna
03:05
want to make sure that's for the latest
03:07
version of Minecraft otherwise that's
03:09
gonna mess you up because obviously I
03:13
can't do it like look when I try look
03:16
what happens alright so maybe you can
03:20
maybe you can't still try but it might
03:23
not have all the blocks in there so it
03:24
might mess it up a little bit so you
03:26
want to make sure that it's for the
03:27
latest one because this was only made in
03:29
2014 so let's let's go to my M Lobby so
03:33
you can even tell there's already a
03:34
difference in it and you know like okay
03:38
so here it is though I have permission
03:43
don't don't no all right well anyway
03:45
this is it it's already like you know it
03:49
works basically and that's how you do it
03:51
and you really don't want to get nobody
03:53
it's really bad so that's how you do if
04:04
I ever finish making this
04:12
oh good I'm just gonna so it's how you
04:21
do it pretty simple but make sure you
04:23
get the latest version and then if you
04:25
want to turn it off ever you just switch
04:27
it back and if you want to open the
04:28
resource pack folder just simply just go
04:30
to that and then if you want to get to
04:33
the roaming file again cuz you forget
04:34
what it is you can just you just open
04:36
the Reapers source pack folder and go up
04:39
here and hit the roaming thing and then
04:41
you're you're back in here and then you
04:42
can just see everything about it and you
04:44
can also see the games your world so you
04:47
can import a new world doing this too
04:49
which is actually gonna be my next video
04:50
and I thank you for watching this video
04:52
and also by the way it might take a
04:55
little bit to load after you press it
04:57
done because that's not actually load
04:59
that you switched the odd pack server
05:02
pack so thank you for watching this it's
05:04
about you smash
